                <p class="article-body first">This type of cryptography uses a public key and a private key as well. This is why it is also called asymmetric encryption, and we should always keep the private key secret. If <b>Alice</b> wants to send a message to <b>Bob</b> then <b>Alice</b> will encrypt it with <b>Bob’s</b> public key and <b>Bob</b> can decrypt the message with his own private key.</p>

Well Diffie-Hellman algorithm is able to exchange private keys over a public channel. It was invented in <b>1976</b> by Diffie, Hellman and Merkle. So this approach is not for encryption or decryption but to securely exchange the private keys for asymmetric cryptosystems. And we can create private keys separately based on modular arithmetic.</p>
                    <p class="article-body">First we have to generate huge prime numbers <b>n</b> and <b>g</b>.

                    <p class="article-body">It is a <b>public key cryptosystem</b> (so it has a private key and a public key), it was constructed in <b>1977</b> by <b>Rivest</b>, <b>Shamir</b> and <b>Adleman</b>. Every public key cryptosystem relies heavily on a trapdoor function and <b>RSA</b> is secure because of the integer factorization problem. Which consist in validating the result by multiplying two numbers and that is easy but finding the factors is hard.</p>
                    <p class="article-body">Let's have <b>p</b> be a prime number than for any integer <b>a</b> (<b>a</b> is not divisible by <b>p</b>) the number <b>a<sup>p-1</sup>-1</b> is an integer multiple of <b>p</b>.</p>
                    <p><b>a<sup>p-1</sup> &#8801; 1 (mod p)</b> which is <b>Fermat's Little Theorem</b>. We can generalize this theorem with Euler's <b>Φ(n)</b> function : this totient function counts the positive integers up to a given integer <b>n</b> that are relative prime to <b>n</b> and the formula is : <b>a<sup>Φ(n)</sup> &#8801; 1 (mod p)</b>. Notably by relative prime we mean that two integers <b>a</b> and <b>b</b> are said to be relative prime or coprime if the only positive integer (factor) that divides both of them is 1 with this formula : <b>gcd(a, b) = 1</b></p>

                            Let's calculate the private key <b>d</b> parameter : let's calculate the modular inverse of <b>e</b> (this is why it is crucial that <b>e</b> and <b>Φ(n)</b> are coprime) :  <b>d * e mod Φ(n) = 1</b>, after solving this equation we get the <b>d</b> parameter.

                        <li class="liste">
                            We have to find now an <b>e</b> number where <b>gcd(e, Φ(n)) = 1</b> with <a class="article-body link" title="Euclidean Algorithm Explanation" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm" target="_blank"><b>Euclide Algorithm</b></a> and we get <b>e = 21</b>.

However <b>quantum computing</b> will make RSA obsolete in the future.</p>
                    <p>The use of elliptic curves in cryptography was suggested independently by <b>Neal Koblitz</b> and <b>Victor S.Miller</b> in <b>1985</b>. It's one of the most popular <b>public key cryptosystems</b>, and <b>Bitcoin</b> uses Elliptic Curve Cryptography.</p>
